### ðŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Central Tendency}}}$
* **Measure of central tendency** yield information about **particular places** or **locations** in a group of numbers.
* A **single number** to describe the **characteristics** of a set of data.

Measure of central tendency yield information about **particular places** or **locations** in a **group of numbers**. Suppose there are a group of number, that group of numbers has to be replaced by <ins><b>a single number</ins></b> that single number we can call it as central tendency. <ins><b>That is a single number to describe the characteristics of a set of data</ins></b>.


### $\large{\color{Purple}1. \underline{\textrm{Arithmetic mean}}}$

* Commonly called 'the mean'
* It is the average of a group of numbers
* Applicable for **interval** and **ratio data**
* Not applicable for **nominal** or **ordinal data**
* Affected by each value in the data set, including **extreme values**
* Computed by summing all values in the data set and dividing the sum by the number of values in the data set

* One of the problem of the with the mean is that it is affected by the extreme values.
* $\Large{\color{Purple} \mu}$ is used as a notation for mean.


### $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Population mean}}}$

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \begin{matrix*}[l]
\mu &=& \dfrac{\sum X}{N}\\
 &=& \dfrac{X_1+X_2+X3+\cdots+X_N}{N}\\
 &=& \dfrac{24+ 13+ 19+ 26+ 11}{5}\\
 &=& \dfrac{94}{5}\\
  &=& 18.6\\
\end{matrix*}}$$

* So, **18.6** is the average of **24, 13, 19, 26, 11** these **5** numbers.
