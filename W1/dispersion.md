### ğŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Dispersion:}}}$
* Measures of variability describe the spread or the dispersion of a set of data
* Reliability of measure of central tendency is the Dispersion
* To compare dispersion of various samples

The **reliability** of measure of <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b> because many times the <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> will **mislead**. So the **reliability** of that <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is calculated by or identified by its **corresponding dispersion**.
