### ðŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Dispersion:}}}$
* **Measures of variability** describe the **spread** or the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b> of a set of data.
* Reliability of measure of <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b>
* To compare dispersion of various samples

The **reliability** of measure of <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b> because many times the <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> will **mislead**. So the **reliability** of that <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is calculated by or identified by its **corresponding dispersion**.

It is used to compare **dispersion** of various samples that is why whenever you plot the data you not only show the **mean** you have to show the **central tendency** also because the **reliability of mean is explained by dispersion**.

* The first **two rows** is no variability in cash flow **mean** is same.
* The second one is **variability in cash flow** see there is a lot of variability in the second one but the mean is same.
*  If you look at only the mean it look like same when you look at only the mean the mean value same but when you look at see the left hand side the second dataset is having more variability.
*  The quality of the mean is explained by its variability that is nothing but dispersion.

### $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Variability or Dispersion:}}}$

#### Common Measures of Variability
1. Range
2. Inter-quartile range
3. Mean Absolute Deviation
4. Variance
5. Standard Deviation
6. Z scores
7. Coefficient of Variation

## $\large{\color{Purple}1. \underline{\textrm{Range: Ungrouped Data}}}$  
* The difference between the largest and the smallest values in a set of data.
* Simple to compute
* Ignores all data points except the two extremes
* Example:  $\large{\color{Purple}Range = Largest - Smallest = 48 - 35 = 13}$
