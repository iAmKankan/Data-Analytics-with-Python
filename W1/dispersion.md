### ðŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Dispersion:}}}$
* **Measures of variability** describe the **spread** or the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b> of a set of data.
* Reliability of measure of <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b>
* To compare dispersion of various samples

The **reliability** of measure of <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is the <ins><b>Dispersion</ins></b> because many times the <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> will **mislead**. So the **reliability** of that <ins><b>Central Tendency</b></ins> is calculated by or identified by its **corresponding dispersion**.

It is used to compare **dispersion** of various samples that is why whenever you plot the data you not only show the **mean** you have to show the **central tendency** also because the **reliability of mean is explained by dispersion**.
