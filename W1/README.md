### ðŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Measures of Central Tendency}}}$
* **Measure of central tendency** yield information about **particular places** or **locations** in a group of numbers.
* A **single number** to describe the **characteristics** of a set of data.

Measure of central tendency yield information about **particular places** or **locations** in a **group of numbers**. Suppose there are a group of number, that group of numbers has to be replaced by <ins><b>a single number</ins></b> that single number we can call it as central tendency. <ins><b>That is a single number to describe the characteristics of a set of data</ins></b>.


### $\large{\color{Purple}1. \underline{\textrm{Arithmetic mean}}}$

* Commonly called 'the mean'
* It is the average of a group of numbers
* Applicable for **interval** and **ratio data**
* Not applicable for **nominal** or **ordinal data**
* Affected by each value in the data set, including **extreme values**
* Computed by summing all values in the data set and dividing the sum by the number of values in the data set

One of the problem of the with the mean is that it is affected by the extreme values. 

### $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Population mean:}}\ \  \ \Large \mu}$
$\Large{\color{Purple} \mu}$ is used as a notation for <ins><b>Population mean</ins></b>.

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \begin{matrix*}[l]
\mu &=& \dfrac{\sum X}{N}\\
 &=& \dfrac{X_1+X_2+X_3+\cdots+X_N}{N}\\
 &=& \dfrac{24+ 13+ 19+ 26+ 11}{5}\\
 &=& \dfrac{94}{5}\\
  &=& 18.6\\
\end{matrix*}}$$

* **18.6** is the average of **24, 13, 19, 26, 11** these **5** numbers.
* So, now the **18.6** can be replaced by these set 5 numbers. Just like suppose, in your class if you see the average mark is **60**. So the whole marks of all the students can be represented to be a single number that is **60**, **60** will give an idea about the **performance of the whole class**.

### $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Sample mean:}}\ \  \ \Large \bar{X}}$
$\Large{\color{Purple} \bar{X}}$ is used as a notation for <ins><b>Sample mean</ins></b>.

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \begin{matrix*}[l]
 \bar{X} &=& \dfrac{\sum X}{n}\\
 &=& \dfrac{X_1+X_2+X_3+\cdots+X_n}{n}\\
 &=& \dfrac{57+ 86+ 42+ 38+ 90+66}{6}\\
 &=& \dfrac{379}{6}\\
  &=& 63.167\\
\end{matrix*}}$$

### $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Mean of Grouped data:}}}$
* Weighted average of class midpoints
* Class frequencies are the weight

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \begin{matrix*}[l]
\mu &=& \dfrac{\sum f M}{\sum f}\\
 &=& \dfrac{\sum f M}{N}\\
 &=& \dfrac{f_1 M_1+f_2 M_2+f_3M_3+\cdots+f_iM_i}{f_1 +f_2+f_3+\cdots+f_i}\\
\end{matrix*}}$$

The mean of your grouped data is nothing but weighted average of class midpoints, class frequencies are the weight. For the formula is $\large{\color{Purple}\mu = \dfrac{\sum f M}{\sum f}}$

### Example of Group Data Calculation:

</p>

$$\Large{\color{Purple}\mu = \dfrac{\sum f M}{\sum f} = \dfrac{2150}{50}=43.0 }$$

See this is the grouped data. What is given class interval is given frequency is given class midpoint is given and multiplied value of frequency and midpoint also we can find out. For example; see here 20 to 30 there are 6 numbers is their frequency 6. Suppose if you say the marks of here if you say this this is an example of here marks obtained by in your class. So between 20 and 30 there are 6 students is there. Between 30 under 40 there are 18 students is there. Suppose for this the data is in this format that is in grouped format how to find out the mean? Okay? First what do you have to do first you have to find out the class midpoint. See 20 to 30 that is a class interval the midpoint is 25, for 30 and 40. The class midpoint is the middle value 35 like this 45, 55, 65, and 75. Next one you have two multiplied by frequency and class midpoint so 6 into 25 is 150, 18 into 35 is 630, 11 into 45 is 495 and so on. What the formula says it is last column the sum value is 2150, 2150/50 Sigma f is some of the frequency so for this kind of grouped data the mean is 43.
