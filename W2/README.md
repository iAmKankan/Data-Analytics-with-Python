### $\Large{\color{purple}\underline{\textrm{Agenda}}}$
* Comprehend the different ways of assigning probability
* Understand and apply marginal, union, joint, and conditional probabilities
* Solve problems using the laws of probability including the laws of addition, multiplication and conditional probability
* Revise probabilities using **Bayes' rule**

### ðŸ”² $\Large{\color{purple}\underline{\textrm{Probability}}}$
$\Large Definition:$ Probability is the numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.
* The probability of any event must be between $\large{\color{purple}0}$ and $\large{\color{purple}1}$, inclusively
   * $\large{\color{purple}0 <= P(A) <= 1}$ for any event $\large{\color{purple}A}$.
* The sum of the probabilities of all mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events is $\large{\color{purple}1}$.
   * $\large{\color{purple} P * (A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1}$
   * $\large{\color{purple}A}$, $\large{\color{purple}B}$ and $\large{\color{purple}C}$ are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive

### ðŸ”² $\Large{\color{purple}\underline{\textrm{Methods of Assigning Probabilities}}}$
1. Classical method of assigning probability (**rules** and **laws**)
2. Relative frequency of occurrence (cumulated historical data)
3. Subjective Probability (personal intuition or reasoning)

### $\Large{\color{purple}1. \underline{\textrm{ Classical Method of Assigning Probability }}}$
* Number of outcomes leading to the event divided by the total number of outcomes possible
* Each outcome is <ins><b>equally likely</ins></b>
* Determined a priori -- before performing the experiment
* Applicable to games of chance
* Objective -- everyone correctly using the method assigns an identical probability
